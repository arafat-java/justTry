git status			==> To know the differences between working dir and repository
					This gives an overview of files that are different.

git add .

git commit -m "message"

git log 
git log -n 3 			==> To see the last 3 commits
git log --since 2012-06-15	==> To see the since that date
git log --until 2012-06-15	==> To see the until that date
git log --author "Arafat"	==> To see the commits only of this author
git log --grep "Init"		==> Regex filtered logs


git diff			==> Seeing the differences between workspace and Repo
git diff --staged		==> Seeing the differences between staged and Repo

git rm <<file name>>		==> Removing the file

git mv <<old_file>> <<new_file>> ==> Moving/Renaming file

git checkout -- aa.html        ==> For overwriting a file in working repository. Double hyphen indicates use current branch
git checkout <<SHA_1>> -- <<file name>> ==> Overwriting a file in working repository with a specific commit. SHA_1 is the commit if of that

git commit -amend <<file name>>	==> To amend to the last commit. Ammendment can even be for changing the commit message

git revert <<SHA_1>> 	==> To revert the branch to an older commit

git reset		==> For resetting the head pointer and/or resest the staging dire and/or resetting the working dir
				Always changes the HEAD pointer. And there are 3 options as follows
				Soft: moves HEAD pointer to specified commit, and doesnt change the staging index or the working directory
				Mixed (default): moves HEAD pointer to specified commit, and it also changes the staging index to match the repository. It does not change the working directory
				Hard : moves HEAD pointer to specified commit, and it also changes the staging index and working dir to match that commit. So all changes in working directory are lost



Question:
Whats the diff between checkout and reset
